# Flight Charts Prediction Using Time Series Forecasting

This project aims to predict flight charts (such as passenger numbers, flight frequencies, etc.) using time series forecasting techniques. The dataset includes historical data of flight metrics over time. The goal is to explore the data, build time series forecasting models, and predict future trends in flight charts.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure, trends, and seasonality in the flight data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Time Series Modeling**: Apply various time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet) to predict flight charts.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the accuracy of the forecasting models using appropriate metrics.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to showcase the historical trends and forecasted flight charts.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes historical flight data, such as:
- Date of flight
- Passenger numbers
- Flight frequencies
- Other relevant features

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis, time series modeling, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Statsmodels**: For implementing time series models like ARIMA and SARIMA.
- **Facebook Prophet**: For time series forecasting.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/1vig/flight-charts-prediction.git
    cd flight-charts-prediction
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks** to explore the data, build time series models, and visualize results:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Results

The project demonstrates the process of predicting flight charts using time series forecasting techniques. The results include:
- Historical data visualizations to understand patterns and trends.
- Forecasted flight charts with confidence intervals.
- Evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy of the forecasting models.
